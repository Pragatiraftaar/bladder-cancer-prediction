Bladder Cancer Prediction (Machine Learning)
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system to analyze medical data and predict bladder cancer outcomes. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison to identify the best-performing approach for prediction.

Project Objectives
Load and explore bladder cancer dataset
Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encoding, scaling)
Train machine learning models for prediction/classification
Evaluate models using performance metrics
Compare results and select the best model

Tech Stack
Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Workflow (Notebook Steps)
Import required libraries
Load dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing and feature preparation

Train-test split
Model building (classification algorithms)
Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
Final prediction and comparison

How to Run
Open the notebook:
bladder_cancer (1).ipynb

Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run all cells in order.

Output
Trained ML model for bladder cancer prediction
Evaluation results and comparison of model performance
Visualizations and metrics for analysis

Future Enhancements
Use advanced models like XGBoost, Random Forest tuning
Add cross-validation for better accuracy
Deploy as a web app for prediction
Use more medical features for stronger results
